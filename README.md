# Fractals

A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals.

## Mandelbrot set

The term Mandelbrot set is used to refer both to a general class of fractal sets and to a particular instance of such a set. In general, a Mandelbrot set marks the set of points in the complex plane such that the corresponding Julia set is connected and not computable.: In mathematics Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers C such
that: Zn+1 = Zn
2+C, starting with Z0 = 0 remains bounded when n reach infinity. In other words if for
some C the above equation remains bounded for after many iterations then that C is in the Mandelbrot
set. There is a mathematical proof which shows that if ABS(Zn) > 2 the above equation will diverge
hence C is not in the Mandelbrot set. Some complex numbers will be in the Mandelbrot set and some
are not.

## Julia Set

The Julia set is now associated with those points z = x + iy on the complex plane for which the series zn+1 = zn2 + c does not tend to infinity. c is a complex constant, one gets a different Julia set for each c. The initial value z0 for the series is each point in the image plane. In the broader sense the exact form of the iterated function may be anything, the general form being zn+1 = f(zn), interesting sets arise with non-linear functions f(z). Commonly used functions include the following:
